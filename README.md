# XML Parser 🚀
##### Axiomatics Challenge 👨‍💻

Visualize the XML tree as if it were on a small IDE

Color scheme inspired by <a href="https://draculatheme.com" target="_blank">Dracula Theme</a>

Have fun!

## Startup Info 🖥️
```sh
npm i
npm start
```

### Incomplete tasks 💔
- Writing tests
- Fixing minor bugs, such as "empty ul" as tried fixing on commit #7eeee8a
- Refactoring components as nested code can be difficult to read
