# XML Parser 🚀
##### Axiomatic Challenge 👨‍💻

Visualize the XML tree as if it were on a small IDE

Color scheme inspired by https://draculatheme.com

Have fun!

## Startup Info 🖥️

```

### Incomplete tasks 💔
- Writing tests
- Fixing minor bugs, such as "empty ul" as tried fixing on commit #7eeee8a
- Refactoring components as nested code can be difficult to read
